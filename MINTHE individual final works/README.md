# **minthe prototypes introduction**
The main function of my code is to create a  dynamic representation that combines music and visual art. The code uses the p5.js library to generate an animated artwork with concentric circles, dynamic patterns, and color variations . It synchronizes the animation with the music's amplitude, allowing the rotation speed and colors to change in response by the volume level of the audio.The core functionality of the code involves fetching the current amplitude level of the playing music through the "amplitude.getLevel" function. This value is then used to determine the desired rotation speed for the circles, which responds to the music's loudness. In addition to this, the code employs random color assignment to infuse the concentric circles with dynamic and vibrant variations, which also adapt to the changes in music loudness.
## first prototype ##[MINTHE individual final works/myfinalwork1](https://github.com/mintheTAN/week7/tree/3f4918665b0cfa2b544cbed728bf0c820a271b55/MINTHE%20individual%20final%20works/myfinalwork1)
In the first prototype, I selected the music "He Lives in You" from Disney's "The Lion King," which perfectly aligns with the artwork's theme of destiny and cyclical nature. The music is vibrant and energetic, allowing code to vividly express its essence through movement and visuals easily. The primary circle exhibits dynamic motion, and its colors undergo captivating transformations. Additionally, I enhanced the visual aesthetics of the artwork by infusing it with randoms colors reminiscent of African cultures
## second prototype ##
In the second prototype, I introduced a mouse-clicking interaction to control the music, allowing it to be paused and resumed. However, I encountered a challenge when attempting to synchronize the stoppage of both circle rotation and random color changes, which unfortunately didn't work as intended. Additionally, I adjusted the speed ratio with the music volume to make the circle movement more responsive and noticeable.*I presented this prototype to my class tutor, received valuable feedback, and used it to refine the project for the final version.*
## final work ## 
In my final work, I added rotation to the small ovals around the main circle, creating a more dynamic and connected visual representation that synchronizes with the music. I also adjusted the speed of the movement to prevent excessive motion that might cause discomfort.
Moreover, I reconsidered the choice of music for the project. I realized that the previous selection was too energetic and failed to capture the nuanced dynamics of the music. In the final version, I opted for the classic song "Circle of Life" from Disney's "The Lion King." This iconic song is known for its unforgettable opening lines, composed with the influence of South African music. While "Circle of Life" carries a distinct African ethnic flavor akin to Pacita's artwork inspiration, it also explores the same theme of destiny's cyclical nature.
